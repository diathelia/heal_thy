New scheme:

 - Use hamburger nav bar with basic info ✔
 - Move open hours and contact info out of nav ✔
 - Move contact info to footer with a nav link to it
   (rethink, do i want contact info to be a banner of info more prominently displayed near the top?)
 - Make open hours prominently displayed on splash page ✔
 - Use parallax scroll for all banner images ✔
 - Use animate on scroll for doctor profiles and other stuff ✔
 - get lighter colour icons: not thicc or black lines
 - add generic hover class to change text/bg to the same colour, transition time etc
 - repurpose smoothscroll links like page-down for nav buttons
 - should i move the map up to where the contact info is?
 - add link to https://www.dunedinurgentdoctors.co.nz/ for emergency section ✔


There should be a logic to the infomation displayed at the top.
Nav is not currently accessible to screen readers and the like (got a strange "2 minutes" text output??)

Google:
Address: 271 Highgate, Roslyn, Dunedin 9010
Hours: Closed ⋅ Opens 8:30AM Mon

Phone: 03-477 6471

New nav:
1. HOURS        --> expands to show
2. CONTACT      --> expands to show phone number, location, email
3. OUR TEAM     --> cuts to doctors

-NOTES-------------------------------------------------

use flexbox for nav-row, use grid for spacing all other content.

info before doctors: 'what we do' using a 3 column grid style with symbols representing each section.

can I poll an API that provides holiday dates? can mondayisation be accounted for?

to detect the scrollbar width in pixels:
window.innerWidth - document.documentElement.clientWidth
Q: is it reliable? --> unneccessary due to changing container width from 100vw to 100%

/*
  style aims:
    shrink nav items and rename them "business hours", "my health care" etc
    change #week-arrow to generalised dropdown arrow (if im gonna use dropdowns)
    display the open/closed status msg something like status: open where 'open' is a noticable colour, maybe has a border etc
    why does the page-down arrow shimmer and look odd as the page scrolls? also how can it be pinned so that it is always centered within the fade?
    is the javascript dor clicking on nav elements something I want? is it best for mobile sizes only? should the nav simply be always on display?
    change the colors of the nav so they look like buttons regardless, keep the slight hover effect, make the click effect more visual
    add animations to page so content slides in etc using aos library
    what color palettes to use? what fonts to use?

    add hover effects as .is-active transitions instead? for mobile only?
    how to manipulate so all sizes see buttons content by default. hover effects
    now kick in on clicks. on mobile could each nav element take up 100% page width
    / be block elements so nav becomes vertical?
